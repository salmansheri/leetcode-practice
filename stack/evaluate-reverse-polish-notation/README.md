## Solution

1. The code initializes an empty list called `stack`. This list will be used as a stack to store intermediate results.

2. It iterates over each token `c` in the given `tokens` list.

3. If `c` is the addition operator '+':

   - It pops the top two elements from the stack and adds them.
   - The result is pushed back onto the stack.

4. If `c` is the subtraction operator '-':

   - It pops the top two elements from the stack, denoted as `a` and `b`.
   - It subtracts `a` from `b` (order matters since it is a stack).
   - The result is pushed back onto the stack.

5. If `c` is the multiplication operator '\*':

   - It pops the top two elements from the stack and multiplies them.
   - The result is pushed back onto the stack.

6. If `c` is the division operator '/':

   - It pops the top two elements from the stack, denoted as `a` and `b`.
   - It divides `b` by `a` (order matters since it is a stack) and converts the result to an integer.
   - The integer result is pushed back onto the stack.

7. If `c` is not an operator but an operand (a number):

   - It converts `c` to an integer and pushes it onto the stack.

8. After processing all tokens, the stack will contain the final result of the RPN expression.
   - The result is retrieved from the top of the stack and returned.

The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the number of tokens in the input list.

- The code iterates over each token once, performing constant-time operations for each token.

The space complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the number of tokens in the input list.

- The space used by the stack can grow up to the number of tokens in the worst case.
- Additionally, the code uses a constant amount of space for the intermediate variables and the result.
- Therefore, the overall space complexity is proportional to the number of tokens in the input list.
